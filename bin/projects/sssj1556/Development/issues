To do:

Parallax solution is still too small. The proper motion solution is correct, 
which suggests that the calibration to standard coordinates is OK.
Problem must be with calculation of parallax factors.
 - they could be too small
    - Earth ephemeris wrong?
    - right ascension/declination of target star wrong?
    - conversion to parallax factors on standard coordinates wrong?

**** Try fitting each parallax factor separately:
    - xsi alone gives parallax  0.028 +/- 0.025
    - eta alone gives parallax  0.039 +/- 0.061
    - both simultaneously gives 0.027 +/- 0.026   -- doesn't seem to make sense!

 - they could be out of phase with epoch of observations
    - Date of images wrong?
    - 

There are two approaches to calibrating standard coordinates:
  - Calculate the standard coordinates of the reference stars and fit to the
    image coordinates to derive the full transformation
  - calculate the standard coordinates of the reference stars and fit to the
    image coordinates only to derive the rotation of the field wrt the 
    celestial sphere. Then, use the angular plate scale to complete the
    transformation from image coordinates to standard coordinates



 - Celestial coordinates of reference stars are poor (used to define transformation
   from image coordinates to tangent plane coordinates)
 - Try specifying rotation of field wrt celestial sphere, angular pixel scale
   and celestial coordinates of target. This provides a means to estimate 
   tangent plane coordinates that doesn't require knowledge of reference star
   celestial coordinates.


Improve calculation of transformation from slave to master - consider errors on
both slave and master reference star coordinates.
