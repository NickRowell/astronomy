WDLF inverter
============

2) Add WDLF (model-obs) residuals to plot
3) Add plot of chi-squared with each iteration

4) Add plot of updated progenitor mass distribution after iteration. Add plot of updated SFR model.

Better density plots -> use combination of points & hess diagram?

Move InitialGuessSFR & InitialSFRForm to sfr package, incorporate into the structure used there.


General
=======

Move all large data files out of the src/resources and into the dedicated data/ directory.

SFR interface is a mess - instead of using a discrete function internally at the base class level, would
be best to simply specify a bunch of methods that SFR implementations must provide. That way the concrete classes
are free to use an analytic representation of the SFR which will speed up e.g. drawing creation times, integrating
the function etc and provide greater accuracy.

Complete merger of proper motion deprojection code & revival of SSS catalogue deprojection class in sss.wdlf package.

WDLF modelling:
 - Forms should not keep a reference to the ModellingState, rather they only keep references to the objects they
   manipulate. This makes the forms more flexible as it doesn't tie them to any particular type of state object.

Merge old SSS code into the sss package; eliminate multiple old copies.

Main sequence lifetime code should not barf if we give a mass outside the range of pre-WD masses. It's the
responsibility of whatever modelling code is invoking the method to check the mass it's giving.

Tidy up test classes -> wd.cooling.test.WDTester
