The files in this directory contain selected data from the full stellar 
evolutionary tracks. For each mass, the total pre-WD lifetime is listed
as a combination of the main sequence and horizontal branch lifetimes.
Technically, the pre-WD lifetime is assumed to end at the first thermal
pulse on the asymptotic giant branch, which is where most of the stellar
models terminate. Low mass models are artificially terminated at arbitrary
times older than the age of the universe.

The data chosen for interpolating pre-WD lifetimes is those masses that
are evolved from the ZAMS to the first thermal pulse (some have only HB
lifetimes). Any low masses that have been terminated early are removed,
so that the data shows a monotonic rise to low mass. This eases the
inverting of the functions and ensures a given pre-WD lifetime has a
unique mass solution.
