WD cooling models
-----------------

Both Montreal group and BaSTI models are available. In both cases, cooling
tracks are interpolated using bilinear approach. The reason for this is to
eliminate artefacts associated with splines/cubics, and to enable the
models to be uniquely inverted (for cooling time at given bolometric magnitude
and mass).

The Montreal DB models have a discontinuity at early times where two 
sets of evolutionary models are joined. At each mass, a selection of points
are excluded from the fit.

In both cases, only C/O core WDs are used. In the case of the Montreal models,
the ratio is fixed at 50:50. The BaSTI models use more realistic abundances
and density profiles obtained from models of main sequence evolution.

BaSTI models offer tracks with and without phase separation on crystallisation.
This process introduces a systematic deviation in the brightness from around
1Gyr onwards, with models including phase separation being around 1mag brighter
at the same cooling age.

The 1.1M_0 BaSTI models have an artefact at the earliest time, which is 
commented out of the tracks for use in this software.

For BaSTI DA & DB models, there is not a unique solution for minimum WD mass for 
total population ages greater than around 23Gyr (depending on metallicity). 
This doesn't affect inversion,
but means low mass limit line cannot be plotted using current method and
program will crash.

Initial Guess SFR
-----------------

Minimum lookback time is always lifetime of most massive MS star. Then there
are a couple of schemes to set bin widths: even spread, or based on cooling
times of some reference WD over fixed ranges in bolometric magnitude.
