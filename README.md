Astronomy Project
==============

This project contains code developed by Nick Rowell for use in astrophysics research. This covers the following topics:

White Dwarf Luminosity Function (WDLF)
--------------

Applications for
 - producing a simulated WDLF given different assumptions about the underlying physics and star formation rate
 - inverting a given observed WDLF to obtain a maximum likelihood estimate of the star formation rate
 
This code was used in the paper Rowell (2013) MNRAS 434, 1549-1564
 
Proper Motion Surveys
----------------
 
Applications for calculating the sampled (generalised) space volumes of proper motion surveys, considering
the survey limits and tangential velocity distribution of the target population. This code was used in the
paper Lam, Rowell & Hambly (2015) MNRAS 450(4), 4098-4108

Other
-----

The project also contains a lot of infrastructure code to support modelling and simulation of stellar populations,
e.g. implementations of the IMF, main sequence models, initial-final mass relation, WD cooling models, ...
